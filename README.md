# Vehicle Detection using OpenVINO
### Description
This project demonstrates a vehicle detection system using OpenVINO for real-time video processing. The system uses a pre-trained vehicle detection model to identify and draw bounding boxes around vehicles in video frames. The project leverages OpenVINO's capabilities to accelerate inference on the CPU, making it suitable for various applications, such as traffic monitoring and autonomous driving.

### Features
Real-Time Vehicle Detection : Detects vehicles in video streams using the OpenVINO framework.

Bounding Boxes : Draws bounding boxes around detected vehicles.

Traffic Analysis : Provides a simple traffic analysis based on the number of detected vehicles.

Video Source Flexibility : Works with various video sources, including webcam feeds and pre-recorded videos.

### Requirements
 - Python 3.x
 - OpenVINO Toolkit
 - OpenCV
